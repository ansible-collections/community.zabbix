  0.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - zabbix_action - allow str values for ``esc_period`` options (see `#66841 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66841>`_).
      - zabbix_action - no longer requires ``esc_period`` and ``event_source`` arguments
        when ``state=absent``.
      - zabbix_host - now supports configuring user macros and host tags on the managed
        host (see `#66777 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66777>`_).
      - zabbix_host_info - ``host_name`` based search results now include host groups.
      - zabbix_hostmacro - ``macro_name`` now accepts macros in zabbix native format
        as well (e.g. ``{$MACRO}``).
      - zabbix_hostmacro - ``macro_value`` is no longer required when ``state=absent``.
      - zabbix_proxy (module) - ``interface`` sub-options ``type`` and ``main`` are
        now deprecated and will be removed in community.general 3.0.0. Also, the values
        passed to ``interface`` are now checked for correct types and unexpected keys.
      - zabbix_proxy (module) - added option proxy_address for comma-delimited list
        of IP/CIDR addresses or DNS names to accept active proxy requests from.
      - zabbix_template - add new option omit_date to remove date from exported/dumped
        template (see `#67302 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67302>`_).
      - zabbix_template - adding new update rule templateLinkage.deleteMissing for
        newer zabbix versions (see `#66747 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/66747>`_).

        template (see `#67302 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67302>`_).
      deprecated_features:
      - zabbix_proxy (module) - deprecates ``interface`` sub-options ``type`` and
        ``main`` when proxy type is set to passive via ``status=passive``. Make sure
        these suboptions are removed from your playbook as they were never supported
        by Zabbix in the first place.

      - zabbix_action - arguments ``event_source`` and ``esc_period`` no longer required
        when ``state=absent``.

        set in zabbix.

        <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67693>`_).
      - zabbix_template - fixed error when providing empty ``link_templates`` to the
        module (see `#66417 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66417>`_).

        (see `#67475 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/67475>`_).

        ``javagateway_listenport`` and ``javagateway_startpollers`` renamed to ``zabbix_javagateway_xyz``

      bugfixes:
      - all roles - a ``handler`` is configured when ``zabbix_http(s)_proxy`` is defined

        execution of the roles are not idempotent anymore.

        higher. When a lower version is used, it will not be added to the configuration.

        for when ``zabbix_repo`` is set to ``epel``.
      - zabbix_server - ``StartPreprocessors`` only works with version 4.2 or higher.
        When a lower version is used, it will not be added to the configuration.
      - zabbix_server - only install the sql files that needs to be executed for when
        ``zabbix_repo`` is set to ``epel``.

        directories.

        repositories files in case it contains credentials.
      - zabbix_agent - can also install the zabbix-agent2 application when ``zabbix_agent2``
        is set to ``true``.
      - zabbix_agent - ``zabbix-sender`` and ``zabbix-get`` will not be installed
        when ``zabbix_repo`` is set to ``epel``, as they are not part of the repository.
      - zabbix_agent - added option to change between HTTP/HTTPS with ``zabbix_repo_yum_schema``.
      - zabbix_proxy (role) - a user and group are created on the host when ``zabbix_repo``
        is set to ``epel``.
      - zabbix_proxy (role) - now supports ``startpreprocessors`` setting and encryption
        when connecting to database (see `#164 <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.zabbix/pull/164>`_).

        is set to ``epel``.

      - zabbix_server - now supports ``startpreprocessors`` setting and encryption

        is set to ``false`` for default installations. For new installations this
        should be set to ``True``. For upgraded installations, please read database
        `upgrade notes <https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/installation/upgrade_notes_500>`_
        (Paragraph "Enabling extended range of numeric (float) values") before enabling
        this option.
      - zabbix_web - added option to change between HTTP/HTTPS with ``zabbix_repo_yum_schema``.
      - zabbix_web - don't remove the files that Zabbix will install during installation
