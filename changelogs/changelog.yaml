      - The inventory script had insufficient error handling in case the Zabbix API
        provided an empty interfaces list. This bugfix checks for an exisiting interfaces
        element, then for the minimal length of 1 so that the first interface will
        only be accessed when it really exists in the api response. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.zabbix/issues/826)
      - zabbix-proxy - updated to install correct sources for Debian arm64 family
      - zabbix_agent - Filter IPv6 addresses from list of IP as Zabbix host creation
        expects IPv4
      - zabbix_agent - installation on Windows will no longer fail when zabbix_agent2
        is used
      - zabbix_host - fix updating of host without interfaces
      - zabbix_proxy - correctly provision tls_accept and tls_connect on Zabbix backend
      - zabbix_proxy - updated the datafiles_path fact for the zabbix_proxy and zabbix_server
        roles due to upstream change
      - zabbix_server - move location of the fping(6) variables to distribution specific
        files (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.zabbix/issues/812)
      - zabbix_server - updated the datafiles_path fact for the zabbix_proxy and zabbix_server
        roles due to upstream change
      major_changes:
      - all modules are opting away from zabbix-api and using httpapi ansible.netcommon
        plugin. We will support zabbix-api for backwards compatibility until next
        major release. See our README.md for more information about how to migrate
