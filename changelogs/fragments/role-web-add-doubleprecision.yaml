minor_changes:
    - A property is added ``zabbix_web_doubleprecision`` which currently is set to ``false`` for default installations. For new installations this should be set to ``True``. For upgraded installations, please read database `upgrade notes <https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/manual/installation/upgrade_notes_500>`_ (Paragraph "Enabling extended range of numeric (float) values") before enabling this option.
