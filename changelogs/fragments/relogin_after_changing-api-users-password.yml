bugfixes:
  - zabbix httpapi plugin - if login failed, it would not be attempted again by later tasks. fix now marks the connection as disconnected on failed login so that later tasks can try 
  - zabbix_user - if the api user's password was changed, session errors would occur in later tasks. fix will relogin to zabbix after changing password of the api user
