minor_changes:
    - The ``zabbix-sender`` and ``zabbix-get`` will not be installed when ``zabbix_repo: epel`` is used, as they are not part of the repository.
    - A user and group are created on the host when ``zabbix_repo: epel`` is configured.

bugfixes:
    - Only install the sql files that needs to be executed for when ``zabbix_repo: epel`` is set.
    - The ``StartPreprocessors`` only works with version 4.2 or higher. When a lower version is used, it will not be added to the configuration.
