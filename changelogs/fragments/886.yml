minor_changes:
  - zabbix_server role - Add variable zabbix_server_dbpassword_hash_method to control whether you want postgresql user password to be hashed with md5 or want to use db default. When zabbix_server_dbpassword_hash_method is set to anything other than md5 then do not hash the password with md5 so you could use postgresql scram-sha-256 hashing method.
