minor_changes:
  - zabbix_proxy_dbpassword - when zabbix_proxy_dbpassword_hash_method is set to anything other than md5 then do not hash the password with md5 so you could use postgresql scram-sha-256 hashing method
  - zabbix_proxy_dbpassword_hash_method - add variable to control whether you want postgresql user password to be hashed with md5 or want to use db default
