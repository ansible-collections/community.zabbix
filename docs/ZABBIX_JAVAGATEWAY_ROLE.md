* `zabbix_repo_yum`: A list with Yum repository configuration.
* `zabbix_repo_yum_schema`: Default: `https`. Option to change the web schema for the yum repository(http/https)
* `zabbix_javagateway_disable_repo`: A list of repos to disable during install.  Default `epel`.

* `zabbix_javagateway_conf_mode`: Default: `0644`. The "mode" for the Zabbix configuration file.

### Java Gatewaty

* `zabbix_javagateway_pidfile`: Default: `/run/zabbix/zabbix_java_gateway.pid`. The location for the pid file.
* `zabbix_javagateway_listenip`: Default: `0.0.0.0`. The IP address to listen on.

* `zabbix_javagateway_startpollers`: Default: `5`. The amount of pollers to start.

### proxy

When the target host does not have access to the internet, but you do have a proxy available then the following properties needs to be set to download the packages via the proxy:

* `zabbix_http_proxy`
* `zabbix_https_proxy`

# Dependencies

The java gateway can be installed on either the zabbix-server or the zabbix-proxy machine. So one of these should be installed. You'll need to provide an parameter in your playbook for using the javagateway.

When using the zabbix-server:
```yaml
  roles:
    - role: community.zabbix.zabbix_server
      zabbix_server_javagateway: 192.168.1.2
```

or when using the zabbix-proxy:
```yaml
  roles:
    - role: community.zabbix.zabbix_proxy
      zabbix_proxy_server: 192.168.1.1
      zabbix_proxy_javagateway: 192.168.1.2
```

## Tags

* `install`:  Tasks associated with the installation of software.
* `dependencies`:  Installation tasks related to dependencies that aren't part of the core zabbix installation.
* `database`: Tasks associated with the installation or configuration of the database.
* `api`:  Tasks associated with using the Zabbix API to connect and modify the Zabbix server.

          zabbix_server_javagateway: 192.168.1.2
